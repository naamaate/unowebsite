 <h2>Week 1 </h2>
 <div>The first week for me was the best. We learnt the basics of python, cue "Hello world" (Apparently there's supposed to be a comma after "hello"). My grammer has never been that good ðŸ¤£. After we did the basics liam dropped the group project brief on us which was due for the end of week 2. This was pretty nerve racking but I was ready for the challenge, or was I. The thing I enjoyed most about this week was we had tasks to consolidate and test all the concepts we were learning. </div>

 <h2>week 2</h2>
<div> The second week was intense. We got split into a team of four and had to come up with a fully functioning game on python by the end of the week. The tools we used were Trello, Python, VSC, slack and zoom. The project showed me the importance of team work and how working to each individuals strength's is the way to deliver a well rounded and decent project. Also the important reminder that sometimes you can't do everything by yourself! </div>

<h2>week 3</h2> 
<div>This week is all HTMl and CSS. Altough I think it is a lot easier than Python, I found python a lot more fun. This may be down to my lack of creativity or soemthing else. I won't provide any pictures to showcase my talent, luckily the proof (or lack of) is in the website. </div>
